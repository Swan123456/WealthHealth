# WealthHealth

WealthHealth is an online application for managing your team. It's Project 14 of the OpenClassrooms "Web App Developer - JavaScript React" course. For this project, I use [React](https://fr.react.dev/) for building the user interface, [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static typing, [Tailwind-CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, and local state management for application state management.

I had to refactor an [old JQuery site](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P12_Front-end) into a modern React app. I independently published this custom Modal component as a [new NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lib-modal-hrnet), but most of the work is in the [HRnet website main repository](https://github.com/Swan123456/WealthHealth)..
